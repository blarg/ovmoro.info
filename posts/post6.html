                <h3>HTML Stuff</h3>
<p>
I've been continuing the process of re-learning HTML and trying to
get my online life in order.
It's def a pain, but is getting there.
I used to know it a lot better, and even finding out good ways to
edit/write it is a real slog.
I'm trying something different with this page right now, and it seems to
be working.
</p>
<p>
It really doesn't help that all the resources online about it are all pretty
bad.
Web practices and web programming standards really feel like they've completely
given up at trying to maintain any consistency in style and even reccomended
use.
Somewhat interestingly, I tried to use Bing's new-ish <i>thing</i> to
help me fix my style problems for this page, and it generated total garbage;
I'm not sure why it was so, so bad, but like <b>wow</b>. I'm really hoping I
can figure it all out before my next post. <tt>lol</tt>

                <h3>Youtube Junk</h3>
<p>
In other news, youtube's annoying and inevitably phyrric crusade against
adblockers has led to the resurgence of several of nitpicks I've had with
the site for a while in my mind &mdash; mostly the weird hover-fail problem
and its consistent failures to handle reloading.
